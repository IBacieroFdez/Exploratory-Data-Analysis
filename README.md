# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This repository contains the results of some EDA projects done or in process

Unfortunately, there are some interactive Plotly figures that can not be rendered in this repo. 
To try solve this incident, a svg version is shared as a taste of what was already built.

If anyone seeing this project is interested in watching these interactive figures, please contact by mail at:
